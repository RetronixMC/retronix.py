### Woah there cowboy, read this before you continue.
- Firstly, please make sure that you're running the most recent version of the library. Nothing's more frustrating than seeing a recommendation of something that already exists. If we can improve it, that's one thing, but please make sure that it doesn't already exist in the most up to date version of the library.
- Secondly, make it obvious what you're describing. ie: improvement or addition. We all want to be on the same page here.
- Thirdly, make sure it hasn't already been suggested in the Issues tab. That's all, I promise. You can go ahead and remove this section now when you're ready to post.

### Give a brief description of what you would like to see in the library
<!-- No more than 3 sentences to a paragraph, just enough to explain in enough detail. -->

### (Optional) Describe the feature in further detail
<!-- Go into further depths of what you would like functionality wise. Put your thumbs or fingers to the keyboard and take a dive! Only optional if the brief description evidently describes the request in adequate detail. In the event of this, you can leave this heading out. -->

### Why should we add it?
<!-- Why would this recommendation make a significant improvement to the operability of the library? Please use a detailed sentence or two rather than just "I think it'll look cool." -->
