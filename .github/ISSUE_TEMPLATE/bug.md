### Pre bug-report checklist : Read before continuing.
#### We'll know if you haven't.
- Firstly, we'd like you to try and repeat the bug by yourself, get a sense of what's going on. That'll help you get a better understanding of the problem, which will in turn provide a better description.
- Secondly, we're busy people. All of us are in reality, we just want to be able to get to the problem as easy as possible. This is why we most importantly ask that before you continue, you check pre-existing issues in the repositiory which describe your issue. Feel free to comment to say that you are able to reproduce the problem.
- Thirdly, while regenerating your token is possible, we still don't recommend that you leak it in the repository at any time. So please be careful if you need to share code.
- Fourthly, please ensure that you're running the most up-to-date version of the library, regardless of the branch variant. It's likely that your problem has already been fixed. If something you were using before has become unavailable after updating, we provide details in the wiki about how to migrate with ease. Best of all, it includes not having to change your code very much! Thank you for reading this far, when you're ready to post, remove this section.
- Fifthly and finally, we're here to help. So remember that the more information we have, the better we can be at not only solving the problem for everyone, but most importantly solving the issue for you. Don't hold back from any information that could help us, even if you don't know a whole load about what might be causing it. Novice or expert, we're here to help.

### Brief description of the issue
<!-- Describe in no greater than a few sentences to a paragraph onto what's going wrong in the code. Include information like what part of the library is non-functional.-->

### How can we reproduce the problem
<!-- In order to determine what's going wrong on our end, we need to know what you're doing to make it happen. Give a step by step list of what to do, what code to include, everything possible. Excluding the token :) -->

### What do you get in return
<!-- Tell us what do you get in response to what you've written above. If there's a traceback, pop it in a code snippet for us. -->

### What should be happening instead
<!-- Well, obviously, what the library is spitting out isn't what you'd expect. So what *were* you expecting:-->
